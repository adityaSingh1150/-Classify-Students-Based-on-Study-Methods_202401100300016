Classify students into learning styles using questionnaire scores. With NumPy, Pandas, and KMeans from scikit-learn, students are grouped based on visual, auditory, and kinesthetic preferences for personalized education.
# 📚 Classify Students Based on Study Methods

This project uses questionnaire responses to classify students into different learning styles using machine learning techniques. The goal is to better understand how students learn and to potentially tailor educational content to their preferred study methods.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Students often have unique ways of absorbing and retaining information. By collecting data through a structured questionnaire, we can analyze study behaviors and group students into categories like:

- Visual Learners
- Auditory Learners
- Reading/Writing Learners
- Kinesthetic Learners

This classification can help educators personalize learning experiences and improve academic performance.

## 📊 Features

- Preprocessing of questionnaire data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Clustering and/or Classification models to group students
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- Visualization of clusters/groups
- Suggestions for personalized study methods

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📝 Dataset

- The dataset is derived from questionnaire responses designed to capture preferred learning styles.
- If you wish to contribute or test the model, please use the provided `sample_questionnaire.csv` format or create your own following the same structure.
